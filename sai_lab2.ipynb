    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "The initial phase of this study involves **data loading and preprocessing**, which lays the foundation for effective analysis and machine learning modeling. The dataset under consideration contains **568,454 user-generated reviews**, capturing textual feedback along with metadata such as numerical ratings, timestamps, and helpfulness scores. Given the sheer volume and diversity of the dataset, meticulous preprocessing is critical to ensure reliability and accuracy in downstream tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Objectives of this Section**\n",
    "- **Efficiently load the dataset** while minimizing memory usage.\n",
    "- **Verify dataset integrity** by inspecting shape and column structure.\n",
    "- **Handle missing values and duplicates** to prevent distortions in analysis.\n",
    "- **Select only relevant features** that contribute to the classification task.\n",
    "- **Engineer a new feature (`Combined_Text`)** by merging short (`Summary`) and long (`Text`) reviews.\n",
    "- **Transform numerical ratings (`Score`) into categorical satisfaction levels (`User_Satisfaction`)** for supervised classification.\n",

    "## **Data Cleaning Steps**\n",
    "1. **Handling Missing Values**:\n",
    "   - Since the `Score` column is central to our classification task, all rows with `NaN` values in `Score` are removed.\n",
    "   - Missing values in textual fields (`Summary` and `Text`) are replaced with empty strings (`\"\"`) to ensure consistency in text processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Removing Duplicates**:\n",
    "   - Identical reviews can distort classification models by **artificially inflating the occurrence of certain labels**. Therefore, we eliminate duplicate rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feature Selection**:\n",
    "   - To reduce computational complexity and enhance model interpretability, we retain only the most pertinent columns:\n",
    "     - `HelpfulnessNumerator`: Number of users who found the review helpful.\n",
    "     - `HelpfulnessDenominator`: Total number of users who rated helpfulness.\n",
    "     - `Score`: The numerical rating given by the reviewer (1 to 5).\n",
    "     - `Summary`: A brief overview of the review.\n",
    "     - `Text`: The full review content.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Feature Engineering (`Combined_Text`)**:\n",
    "   - The `Summary` column contains **concise expressions of user sentiment**, whereas the `Text` column provides **detailed qualitative feedback**.\n",
    "   - To **capture both short- and long-form sentiment**, we concatenate them into a new column:  \n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     Combined_Text = Summary + \" \" + Text\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Transforming the `Score` Column**\n",
    "The numerical `Score` column is mapped to categorical `User_Satisfaction` levels as follows:"

    "Before training a classification model, it is crucial to **partition the dataset into training and testing subsets**. This ensures:\n",
    "- **Generalizability**: The model is evaluated on unseen data.\n",
    "- **Avoiding Overfitting**: Prevents the model from memorizing patterns in training data.\n",
    "- **Measuring Model Performance**: Provides an unbiased estimate of accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Data Preparation Steps**\n",
    "1. **Label Encoding**:\n",
    "   - Since `User_Satisfaction` is a categorical variable, it is transformed into **numerical labels** via `LabelEncoder()`.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     \"Highly Satisfied\" → 0\n",
    "     \"Satisfied\" → 1\n",
    "     \"Neutral\" → 2\n",
    "     \"Not Satisfied\" → 3\n",
    "     \"Very Bad\" → 4\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Train-Test Split**:\n",
    "   - We perform an **80-20 split**, where **80%** of the data is used for training and **20%** for evaluation.\n",
    "   - **Stratified Sampling** ensures that the **class distribution remains proportional** in both training and test sets.\n",
